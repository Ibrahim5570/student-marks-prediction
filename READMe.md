# 📊 Student Exam Score Prediction using PyTorch ANN

A machine learning model that predicts student exam scores based on 19 socio-academic and behavioral factors using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with **PyTorch**.

This project demonstrates end-to-end workflow: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and real-time prediction.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Trains a custom ANN to predict continuous exam scores (regression).
- Uses real-world student performance data with categorical & numerical features.
- Preprocesses data with `StandardScaler` and proper encoding.
- Saves trained model and scaler for reuse.
- Interactive prediction script for real-time inference.
- Clean, modular, and well-documented code.

▶️ Usage 
---
## 1. Train the Model
```bash
  python train_student_model.py
```
* Trains the ANN and saves:
* model/Ann_exam_score_model.pkl
* model/scaler.pkl

## 2. Predict Marks
```bash
    python predict_exam_score.py
```
* Prompts for 19 student attributes.
* Outputs predicted exam score (0–100).

📈 Model Performance (Example)
---
| Metric       | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| R² Score     | 0.85+ |
| RMSE         | ~5.0  |


Note: Performance depends on data quality and preprocessing.
